A bootcamp assignment to practice:

    Build a login and registration page with validations
    Practice Flash messages
    Practice session
    Use Bcrypt and handle passwords


To do:
1. get birthday stuff working - done
2. Log out at root access only if the user clicked "log out" link - done
3. stylesheets
4. bonus material


As always, I am aware that my key is in the repo, this is not to be deployed, but merely an exercise.

Rev2- included a basic post & comment "wall" page in place of the blank "success" page after registration or login.
